This project contains multiple versions of data generators, utils and training and evaluation files. This version is tailored to fit manufacturing data to our inference logic. Please try inference with only manufacturing data named "static_configuration_plan" 
The trained agents are trained without taking priority into consideration. Since Manufacturing data had a dynamic priority assignment, i have avoided priority for the final manufacturing data results. 
This master version is highly modified to accomodate manufacturing data. 
Another branch with no modifications for manufacturing data will also be released shortly.
